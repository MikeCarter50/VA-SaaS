Cloud Service Providers must be compliant with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) in order to conduct business with VA and integrate with VA information systems and processes. While the provider does not have to be FedRAMP authorized upon initial engagement, it is expected that providers will work with VA and a recognized 3PAO to perform a security assessment, compile a FedRAMP authorization package and provide that package to VA in support of an ATO decision which will be communicated to the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO).
